              We believe finding the right moment in your video archive
              shouldn&apos;t require compromising your timeline or your source’s
              trust. We built Ugle to eliminate the trade-off between search
              speed and data security.

                Most modern tools ask you to upload your sensitive, unreleased
                footage to a cloud server to index it. We think that approach is
                fundamentally broken for professional workflows.

              <p>
                By shifting heavy AI transcription and semantic indexing
                entirely to local hardware, Ugle gives you 30ms search speeds
                while keeping your files completely secure.
