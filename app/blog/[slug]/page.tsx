        <p className="text-[20px] text-ugle-gray leading-[1.55] mb-8">
          The first version of what became Ugle uploaded files to a server. We
          built it that way because it was easier — existing transcription APIs,
          no on-device model to maintain, faster to ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          We showed it to an investigative journalist we respect. She looked at
          the interface and said, without hesitating:
        </p>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;Where does the audio go?&rdquo;</blockquote>
        <p>We told her. She closed the laptop.</p>
        <p>
          That was the answer. Not the architecture decision — the moment before
          it. The fact that the first question a professional journalist asked
          about a tool for her source recordings was about data location told us
          everything about what kind of tool this needed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cloud version worked. Fast, accurate, reasonably priced. It also
          required trust we had no right to ask for — trust that the server was
          secure, that data was not being used to train models, that a legal
          demand would not reveal a source. Not unreasonable conditions for a
          transcription tool. Unreasonable conditions for a journalism tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          On-device transcription was technically harder. Larger models. Tighter
          engineering constraints. We wrote a custom inference pipeline, managed
          model distribution, and solved for hardware variation across consumer
          machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth it. Not because local-first is a feature. Because for the
          workflows Ugle is built for, it is the only architecture that respects
          the user&apos;s actual situation.

        <p className="text-[20px] text-ugle-gray leading-[1.55] mb-8">
          A documentary editor we spoke to last year spends six to ten hours a
          week scrubbing through footage to find moments she already knows
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has watched most of it once. She cannot remember timestamps. She
          scrubs to the rough third of a clip where a subject seemed agitated,
          plays from there, rewinds, tries again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not unusual. It is the default workflow for anyone who works
          with recorded media and has more footage than they can hold in active
          memory. Which is everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is not a lack of tools. There are transcription tools.
          Annotation tools. Summary tools. None of them make the archive
          searchable the way a text document is searchable.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you open a 15,000-word transcript and press Cmd+F, you find every
          instance of a word in under a second. The entire document is equally
          accessible. No part is harder to retrieve than any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is what Ugle does for recorded media. Once indexed, a recording
          becomes as findable as a text file. Type what you are looking for. 30
          milliseconds.

        <p className="text-[20px] text-ugle-gray leading-[1.55] mb-8">
          We say 95% accuracy. That number is word error rate measured against
          manually transcribed ground truth across languages, accents, recording
          conditions, and speaker types.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice: in a 1,000-word recording, approximately 50 words will be
          wrong. Errors cluster around proper nouns, field-specific terminology,
          heavy regional accents, and poor audio quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          For search, this matters less than it sounds. You are searching{" "}
          <em>&apos;rent control&rsquo;</em>, not{" "}
          <em>&lsquo;Councillor Singh&rsquo;</em>. The model is unlikely to miss{" "}
          <em>&lsquo;rent control&rsquo;</em> in a clean recording.
        </p>
        <p>
          For verbatim quotation, always verify against the source. Ugle makes
          this fast — click any result and the audio plays from that timestamp.
